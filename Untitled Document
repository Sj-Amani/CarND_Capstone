# Autonomous Vihecle Architecture:
The vehicle has 4 major subsystems:

In the following, I put very good explanation videos from [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com) to learn more about the subsytems.

## The sensor subsystem
Sensors are the hardware components your car uses to observe the world such as cameras and lidar.

## The Perception Subsystem

## The Planning Subsystem

## The Control Subsystem
Learn [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=6pFy9q_AOJA&feature=emb_logo) about the Control subsystem in the architecture of autonomous vihecles.

# ROS
For communications between systems, we use the Robot Operating System (ROS). It is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your robotics project. And it's all open source. 
If you are beginner and not familiar with ROS, for learning about ROS, I highly suggest you to start from [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). 

## Importance of ROS for SDC
Once you build a self-driving car (SDC), you often have up to 50 processes running at the same time. Some might even crash while you are driving. So, having a felxible architecture like ROS wrapped around it would be supremely helpful to build scalable software.
